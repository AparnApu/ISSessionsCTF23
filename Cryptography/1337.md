<h2> Hint </h2>
Check out the website dcode and see if you can find an existing tool to decode this! <br>
Maybe the name of the challenge can help you determine what type of code it is.

<h2> Breakdown </h2>
As this is a cryptography problem and the title is <b>1337</b>. The type of encryption is right in front of us.
The flag is encrypted using <b>1337</b> encoding.

<h2> Step 1 </h2>
To confirm that the encryption is in fact <b>1337</b>, you can use a <b>https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier</b> and copy the flag provided to us in the aforementioned website to detect the cipher. <br>

As you can see on the left handside, the website has determined that the most likely cipher used on the flag is <b>Leet Speak 1337</b>.

<h2> Step 2 </h2>
Use a tool like <b>https://www.dcode.fr/leet-speak-1337</b> which will decrypt a <b>Leet Speak 1337</b> cipher.

We get a list a possibilities of the words for the flag. We can assume that the correct options for the flag are the REAL english words. <br>
We know that the flag formatting is something like <b>retroCTF{...}</b>. <br>
We can make out the flag as such, <b>retroCTF{World Wide Web}</b>.
